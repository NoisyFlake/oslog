## Note:
this is a fork of the original project created by limneos, in this version I’ve adjusted and added the following features:

 1. Color integration
 2. Updated the entitlements to support a wider range API’s
 3. Updated the project’s build hierarchy to be compatible with modern versions of Theos + very minor adjustments to the code to improve all around usability (date view, usage, etc.)
 4. Removed `log_message->category` as it's uninitialized since iOS 14.5 and will segfault

## Example output:
